**Echoes of Isolation** is a retro FPS horror game inspired by the graphics and gameplay of the PS1 era. Developed using the Unity Game Engine, this game immerses players in a chilling, atmospheric adventure filled with puzzles, intense exploration, and terrifying encounters.

## Story

_In the remote wilderness of Duskridge Mountains, there stands a forgotten relic of the past - the Whispering Pines Asylum. Once a beacon of hope for the mentally ill, it now lies abandoned, its halls echoing with untold secrets._

_You are Dr. Ethan Chen, a renowned psychologist specializing in extreme cases of agoraphobia. Your latest case has brought you to this desolate place - a patient named Michael, who hasn't left the asylum in decades._

_As you approach the decaying structure, a sense of unease washes over you. The asylum looms before you, its windows dark and uninviting. You've been warned that the building's condition is hazardous, but nothing could have prepared you for what awaits inside._

_With only your wits, your training, and a flashlight to guide you, you step into the unknown. Your mission: to find Michael and unravel the mystery that has kept him bound to this place for so long._

_But be warned, Dr. Chen. In Whispering Pines, reality is fragile, and Michael's fears may have taken on a life of their own..._

**Good luck. You're going to need it.**
